      The guys from Signavio have created a web-based BPMN modeler. If you don't know it yet, you should it
      <a href="http://www.signavio.com/camunda">give it a try</a>. It's extremely intuitive to use (so it's perfect
      for Business users) and offers several helpful collaboration features, including a sophisticated API, which is
      why Cycle currently works best with Signavio.

<h3>Forward: From Signavio to camunda Modeler</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Setup Signavio Connector</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="signavio-connector" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/signavio-connector.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      For directly accessing your process models stored in Signavio, you must setup a Signavio Connector.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our example, we use Signavio's SaaS edition and provide the credentials globally, meaning that every Cycle
      user will use the same credentials when using this connector. If you are behind a proxy, you could configure
      that here as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can access your Signavio account.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Step 2: Add process model from Signavio</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="signavio-choose-model" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/signavio-choose-model.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>
      In the left box of your roundtrip, click on "Add process Model", pick a name and choose "Signavio SaaS" from the
      connectors dropdown. Cycle now connects with Signavio, so after a short time you can navigate through the tree
      to select your process model.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you hit "Add", Cycle will save a link to the process model you selected, and offers you a preview image
      in the left box of your roundtrip. It also says that the process model has not yet been synchronized, which
      is true.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Step 3: Create BPMN file for execution</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-create-executable" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/cycle-create-executable.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>
      Hit "Create" and choose the location you want the BPMN 2.0 XML File to be stored to. In our example, we want to
      store it on our local file system, in a workspace we use with our Eclipse IDE. After hitting "Create", Cycle
      will connect to Signavio, request the BPMN 2.0 XML and save it to the location you specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Heads up!</b> If your process model is a collaboration diagram, Cycle will check which pools are flagged as
      "executable". Only those pools will actually be regarded for the executable process model, so you don't have to
      bother with huge diagrams describing manual flows, while you are only interested in the technical flows that
      shall be executed by the process engine. We call this feature "Pool Extraction".
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now either check out the BPMN 2.0 - XML from your Subversion or open it directly in your local drive.
      In both cases, you can now edit inside your Eclipse IDE it using
      <a href="<%= @docUrl('bpmn/modeler.html') %>">camunda Modeler</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Step 4: Edit BPMN File</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-signavio-created" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/signavio-created.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Cycle now shows you that your roundtrip consists of the BPMN diagram stored in Signavio (left side) and the
      BPMN 2.0 File stored in your file repository (right side). You can also see that the two process models are
      currently in synch, and the date and time since the last synch has been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now either check out the BPMN 2.0 - XML from your Subversion or open it directly in your local drive.
      In both cases, you can now edit inside your Eclipse IDE it using
      <a href="<%= @docUrl('bpmn/modeler.html') %>">camunda Modeler</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Reverse: From camunda Modeler to Signavio</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Deciding to synch back in Signavio</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-edited" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/cycle-edited.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Assuming that you have edited the BPMN 2.0 XML in <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/installation-guide/camunda-modeler/">camunda
      Modeler</a>, e.g. because you enriched it with execution attributes, added objects or removed some, you should
      bring those changes back into Signavio: Firstly, your Business Analyst probably wants to know about the changes
      and approve them, and secondly, if you want to change the BPMN diagram in Signavio, you should first synchronize
      it with the file you have changed in camunda Modeler, so that the next forward engineering synch from Signavio
      to camunda Modeler does not overwrite all the changes you have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have Edited the BPMN 2.0 XML in camunda Modeler, Cycle will you tell you that the two process models
      are not in synch any more.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Step 2: Synch back</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="cycle-synchback" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/cycle-synchback.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Click on the lower "Synch"-Button to actually re-import the BPMN 2.0 XML you have edited into Signavio. Since
      Signavio supports versioning, this will lead to a new version of the BPMN diagram that is stored there. You can
      also edit the commit message that Cycle will write when pushing that new version into Signavio.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Heads up!</b> If the BPMN diagram in Signavio is a collaboration diagram (i.e. if it consists of multiple
      pools), Cycle will only overwrite the executable process engine pool.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Step 3: Compare Revisions</h4>
<div class="row">
  <!--<div id="cycle-synchback" class="thumbnail col-md-2" data-img-thumb img-src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/cycle/cycle-synchback.png') %>" ></div>-->
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">ToDo: Screenshot</div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      You can use the "compare revisions"-Feature in Signavio for checking the changes.
