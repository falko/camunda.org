<p>Let's begin our BPMN tutorial with a rather simple process diagram:</p>
<div class="label label-warning">Hover over orange symbols for explanation</div>
<div id="simple" data-bpmn-diagram="tutorial/simple_flow">
  <div class="tutPop" id="sid-B04D1D48-F63A-440D-8354-072FEA072E41" title="Start Event"
       data-content="Start events show which event causes the process to start. Start Evens are always catching events.">
  </div>
  <div class="tutPop" id="sid-4A1FEF34-88D7-4845-940F-9C048C11B5A6" title="Task"
       data-content="Tasks are the heart of the process. Ultimately, something has to happen to bring about a desired
       outcome. In BPMN, a task technically is part of the activities category, which also includes the sub-process">
  </div>
  <div class="tutPop" id="sid-BC888BAA-90B0-4173-ACAA-F1621EE71B2D" title="Intermediate Event"
       data-content="Intermediate events stand for a status that is reached in the process and that is modeled
       explicitly. They are used infrequently, but intermediate events can be useful, for example, if you regard
       reaching a certain status as a milestone and you want to measure the time until the milestone is reached.
       Intermediate none events are always throwing events.">
  </div>
  <div class="tutPop" id="sid-153C934A-CC9F-4169-A816-6CBE7B159D1E" title="End Event"
       data-content="End events mark the status reached at the end of the process path. End events are always throwing
       events.">
  </div>

<p>This diagram shows a simple process triggered by someone being hungry. The result is that someone must shop for
  groceries and prepare a meal. After that, someone will eat the meal and have his or her hunger satisfied.</p>
<div class="panel-group" id="accSimple">
  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accSimple" href="#collapseOne">

        <p>
          When naming tasks, we try to adhere to the object-orientated design principle of using the [verb] + [object]
          pattern. We would say "acquire groceries," for example, not "first take care of shopping for groceries."
        </p>
        <p>
          Events refer to something that has already happened regardless of the process (if they are catching events)
          and as a result of the process (if they are throwing events). For this reason, we use the [object] and make
          the [verb] passive in voice, so we write "hunger noticed." BPMN does not require you to model start and end
          events for a process - you can leave them out - but <b>if</b> you model a start event, you must model an end
          event for each path. The same is true for end events that require start events. We always create our models
          with start and end events for two reasons: first, that way it's possible to determine the process trigger, and
          second, you can describe the final status of each path end. We only sometimes abandon this practice with
          sub-processes. More on this later.

        <p>
          You could always draw your diagrams from top to bottom instead from left to right - the BPMN 2.0 standard does not
          forbid it. However we do not recommend it: It is very uncommon, and experience has proven that people tend to
          understand the process flow better if it is described in the same way like written text (from left to right, at
          least in the western world).
