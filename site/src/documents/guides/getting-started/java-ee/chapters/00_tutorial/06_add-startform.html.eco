      As a next step, we want to add an actual JSF start form.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Add a Start Form</h3>
<p>
  Back to eclipse, add a file named <code>placeorder.xhtml</code> to the <code>src/main/webapp</code> folder.
  Add the following content:
</p>

<div class="app-source" data-source-code="placeorder.xhtml" annotate="code-annotations"></div>

<p>
  The JSF view creates a simple input form for a customer name, address and a pizza selection.
  Additionally an event listener is configured which is triggered before the view will be rendered.
  It will call the <code>camundaTaskForm.startProcessInstanceByKeyForm()</code> method which extracts
  the process definition key from the URL and starts a conversation for the start form.
</p>
<p>
  The user inputs inside the form fields are saved as a map of process variables inside the conversation.
</p>
<p>
  On form submit the <code>camundaTaskForm.completeProcessInstanceForm()</code> method starts a
  new process instance by the process definition key which was determined by the
  <code>startProcessInstanceByKeyForm()</code> method. Additionally the process variables set by
  the user are passed to the process instance.
</p>

<h3>Configure the Start Form in the Process</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img id="pizza-order-start-form" data-img-thumb src="<%= @docUrl('assets/img/get-started/javaee/pizza-order-process-start-form.png') %>" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Open the process with the modeler plugin. Click on the start event. In the properties view, set the
      <code>Form Key</code> property to <code>app:placeorder.jsf</code>. This means that we want to use an external
      JSF form and that the form is loaded from the <code>app</code>lication.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are done, save all resources and perform a Maven build and redeploy the process application.
    </p>
    <p class="alert">
      <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> <strong>Maven:</strong> It is best to perform a
      <code>clean install</code> build to make sure all resources are replaced with their newest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you open the Tasklist and start a new process instance for the pizza order process, the JSF form is
      displayed.
    </p>
